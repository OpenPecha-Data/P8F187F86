This prayer of aspiration for travelling to the supreme and sacred buddha-field of Lotus Light
in Ngayab Ling, no different from a natural nirmāṇakāya pure land, is known as ‘The Secret
Path to the Mountain of Glory’. It was to fulfil the wishes of Dharmakīrti, a yogic practitioner
of the Oral Lineage of the Vajra Queen, that the moonbeams of compassion, the blessings
of the Dharma King of Orgyen and his consort, fell upon the heart of the heruka Padma
Wangchen―a yogin with mastery of the direct and crucial points of the Clear Light Dzogpachenpo―and
he composed this at Samyé Chimphu, from his retreat seat in the Flower Cave,
the assembly hall of all the ḍākinīs in Akaniṣṭha.
