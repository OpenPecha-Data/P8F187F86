revealed by Jigme Lingpa

emaho
Emaho!
gyaché choklhung dralwé shyingkham né
In the heavenly realm, free from all dimensions and extremes,
dangpö sangye chöku kuntuzang
Is the Primordial Buddha, the dharmakāya Samantabhadra;
longku chudé roltsal dorjé sem
His wisdom play, like the reflection of the moon in water, the saṃbhogakāya Vajrasattva;
tulkur tsen dzok garab dorjé la
Perfect with all buddha qualities, nirmāṇakāya Garab Dorje;
solwa deb so jinlab wangkur tsol
To you I pray: Grant me your blessings and empowerment!
shiri singha döndam chö kyi dzö
Śrī Siṃha, treasure of the ultimate Dharma;
jampal shenyen tek gü khorlö gyur
Mañjuśrīmitra, universal ruler of the Nine Yānas;
jnanasutra penchen bimalar
Jñānasūtra, great paṇḍita Vimalamitra;
solwa deb so droljé lam na tön
To you I pray: Show me the way to make my mind free!
dzambuling gi gyen chik pema jung
Padmasambhava, sole ornament of this world of ours,
ngepar tuk kyi sé chok jebang drok
Your supreme heart-disciples, Trisong Detsen, Vairotsana, and Yeshe Tsogyal;
tuk ter gyatsö da drol longchen shyab
Longchenpa, who revealed a vast ocean of wisdom mind treasures;
khandrö ying dzö kabab jikmé ling
Jikme Lingpa, entrusted with the space treasury of the ḍākinīs;
solwa deb so drebu tob drol tsol
To you I pray: Grant me fruition and liberation!
si lé ngepar jungwé shyenlok gi
Through true renunciation and disgust for saṃsāra,
dorjé lama dönden mik shyin ten
May I rely upon my vajra lama meaningfully, as though he were my very eyes,
chi sung kadrub zabmö nyamlen la
Following his instructions to the letter, and taking to heart the profound practices he gives,
temkyang mepé drub tsuk shyé rü kyi
Not just now and then, but with diligent and constant application,
tukgyü gongpé jinlab powar shok
May I become worthy of the transmission of his profound wisdom mind!
nangsi khordé yené womin shying
Since all that appears and exists, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa, from the very beginning is the Akaniṣṭha
pure realm of the buddhas,
lha ngak chökur dak dzok minpé dré
Where all appearance is liberated into perfect buddha forms; all sounds are purified into mantra;
all thoughts are matured into dharmakāya;
panglang jatsol mepé dzokpa ché
And since Dzogpachenpo is free of any effort of abandoning and adopting,
shenyam yichö lé dé rigpé dang
And since rigpa’s self-radiance is beyond thoughts and experience,
chönyi ngönsum jenpar tongwar shok
May I see the naked reality of dharmatā!
tsenmé tokpa namdrol jazer bub
May all ordinary clinging to reality be totally liberated into rainbow light,
ku dang tiklé nyam nang gong du pel
And the experiences of kāyas and tiklés increase!
riktsal longkü shyingkham tsé la peb
May rigpa’s strength be enhanced, maturing into the fullness of saṃbhogakāya perfection!
chö zé lodé chenpor sangye té
As all perception of phenomenal reality wears out, and the conceptual mind dies into the state
of total enlightenment,
shyönnu bumkur tensi zinpar shok
May I gain the stronghold of the youthful vase body, free from birth and death!
shintu naljor nyam ok machü dé
But if I am not able to master the practice of the great Atiyoga in this life,
rak lü dangmé ying su madrol na
And this gross physical body is not liberated into the pure space of the rainbow body,
nam shyik tsé yi dujé tungwé tsé
Then, when the constituents that form this life fall apart—
chiwa ösal kadak chökur shar
At the moment of death may the ground luminosity arise as the dharmakāya, pure from the beginning;
bardö nangcha longchö dzok kur drol
May appearances of the bardo experience be liberated into saṃbhogakāya forms;
trekchö tögal lam gyi tsal dzok né
And, perfecting the path of trekchö and tögal,
mapang bu juk tabur drolwar shok
May I be liberated, as naturally as a child running into its mother’s lap!
sang chen ösal tekpa chok gi tsé
In this great secret mantrayāna path of luminosity—Dzogpachenpo—the summit of all,
sangye shyen né mitsol chökü shyal
Enlightenment is to be sought nowhere but in the face of the dharmakāya.
ngön gyur dömé sa la madrol na
If I'm not liberated into the primordial state by actualizing this,
magom sangye chö ngé lam chok la
Then, by taking the sublime path of the five practices of ‘enlightenment without meditation’,1
ten né rangshyin trulpé shying nga dang
May I be born in one of the naturally emanated realms of the five buddha families,2
khyepar pema ö kyi podrang du
And especially in the ‘Palace of Lotus Light’, the Zangdokpalri heaven of Guru Rinpoche,
rigdzin gyatsö tso chok orgyen jé
In the presence of the Lord of Orgyen himself, chief of the ocean of vidyādhara masters,
sang chen chö kyi gatön gyepé sar
While he is celebrating the feast of the great secret mantra Dharma,
sé kyi tuwor kyé né ukyung té
Let me be born as his favourite son or daughter,
tayé drowé nyer tsor dak gyur shok
To take upon myself the task of helping limitless beings!
rigdzin gyalwa gyatsö jinlab dang
Through the inspiration and blessing of the ocean of victorious vidyādharas,
chöying sam mi khyabpé denpa yi
By the truth of the dharmadhātu, beyond conception,
daljor ten la dzok min jang sum gyi
And with this free and well-favoured human form, may I train in the three activities of perfecting,
ripening and purifying,
tendrel ngön gyur sangye tobpar shok
And by actualizing this auspicious interconnection, attain the state of buddhahood!
