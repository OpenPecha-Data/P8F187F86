Skull Fragments: The Root Tantra of the Vidyādharas

from the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse

by Jigme Lingpa

oṃ āh hūṃ mahāguru sarva herukaSkull Fragments: The Root Tantra of the VidyādharasHomage to
the glorious Heruka!

Tantra means continuum:Not originating from causes and free from conditions.The tantra of the
essence of the Bliss-Gone Ones, awareness itself,Is beyond elaborations, utterly pure, and
the nature itself:Unfabricated, unaltered, thus gone.

The methods to actualize itConstitute the tantra of the path.Although limitless in number, in
short they are as follows:Father Tantras provide skilful means;Mother Tantras teach mainly
insight;Non-Dual Tantras of Union present these elements[1] in equal measure.

Freedom from permanence and nihilism is the view.Conduct should be in accord with place and
time.Then there is maṇḍala, perfecting the clarity of mudrā,And perfecting the four enlightened
activities.The entrance door is the specific empowerment,Its life-force the samaya.The
essence of the deity is secret mantraAnd mudrā carries the power of truth.Keeping the deities
close to one’s heart is the approach,Accomplishment is the group practice,And offerings
increase the accumulation of merit.These are the eleven topics of tantra.The learned
maintain these to be the summarizing points.

Furthermore, the distinguishing features of the tantras,Scriptures and pith instructions should
be understood.Tantras are the Words of the Teacher.Scriptures are summaries made by those
who requested them.And the pith instructions, which clarifyAll that is complicated, confusing
or concealed,Are of three types: those that explainBy means of essence, literal meaning
and the three of enumerations and the rest:So that there is no confusion regarding the
nature of the essence,No doubt about literal meanings,Enumerations are understood and put
into practice,And any disorder is resolved.

Furthermore, the generation phase is of provisionalAnd the perfection phase of definitive meaning.Indirect
teachings convey the opposite of what is saidAnd not-indirect teachings the
reverse of that.[2]Similarly, there are the hidden and the not hidden.Then there are the
literally true and the not literally true.These are the crucial pith instructions of the six
limits.[3]

By means of pith instructions with the four modes in particular—The linguistic and the general,The
hidden and the ultimate—One savours the meaning of the profound king of tantras.

The tantra of the result is the Dharma of the essence.When all obscurations, the various objects
of purification,Are eliminated in actuality through the power of the truth of the pathAnd
the two accumulations, one realizes enlightened body, speech and mind,Which have the
nature of indestructible wisdom,And reaches the essence of awakening itself,Which is beyond
words and cannot be exemplified.

To make these points clearer one must understandThat everything occurs within one’s own perception.The
main teacher and the assembled retinue,The Dharma to be accomplished and all those
who accomplish itAre no different from oneself:As wisdom, the radiance of the ninefold
expanse,As yidam deities, the Eight Great Maṇḍalas of the Sādhana Class;As bodhisattvas,
the Eight Close Sons;As vidyādharas, like this:In Uḍḍiyāna, the naturally arisen land of the
ḍākinīs.In the Great Cool Grove[4] strewn with corpses,[The vidyādharas] gathered, and
when it came time to discipline beings,The Heruka, abiding in the Unsurpassed Realm,Placed
the eloquently written tantras of the entire assembly of Bliss-Gone OnesIn the Śaṅkarakūṭa
caitya.The Great Karmendrāṇī extracted themAnd entrusted them to the eight vidyādharas.


To Vimalamitra,Born in the country of Zahor,She entrusted the casket of Supreme Heruka-Amṛtakuṇḍalin.


To Mañjuśrīmitra,Born in Malaya as the son of a Brahmin,She entrusted the casket of Supreme
Body—Mañjuśrī.

To the brilliant Nāgārjuna,Born in Vedalī[5] in brahmin family,She entrusted the casket of Supreme
Speech—Padma.

To Hūṃkāra,Born on the forested isle of Singhala,She entrusted the casket of Supreme Mind—Yangdak.


To Prabhahasti,Born in the country of Uḍḍiyāna, the land of the turbaned ones,She entrusted
the casket of enlightened activity—Kīla.

To Dhanasaṃskṛta,Born in the country of Tokhara,[6]She entrusted the casket of Fully Perfected
Heruka.

To Rombuguhyacandra,Born in the land of ḍākinīs,She entrusted the casket of Worship of the Tamer
of Haughty Spirits.

To Śāntigarbha,Born in a grove on an island,She entrusted the casket of Maledictory Fierce Mantra.


None of these were ordinary independent beings.Although it seemed as if deities existed and
transmissions took place,In reality, the practice and practitioners were of a single taste,Merely
appearing within the perception of those to be trained.Similarly, the great KarmendrāṇīEntrusted
the precious casket that contains all,To the Vidyādhara who had been miraculously
bornOn the isle of Lake Dhanakośa.[7]

The Teacher himself emanated as the vidyādhara Vajradharma—Compiler of the teachingsAnd keeper
of the profound secrets.These nectar-like pith instructionsWere seemingly revealed by the
teacher to his students.It is the fruition of the entire Secret Mantra Vehicle,The sacred
teaching entrusted to the mighty king.[8]

“When you[9] are in your last of thirteenPure and impure emanations in this world,When your
compassionate incarnations,Including those with number, such as the twenty-one, and those
countless in number,Appear everywhere,You will come disguised as an ordinary person.One of
your seven speech incarnationsWill be empowered with the aspirational entrustments.When the
time comes to benefit beingsOnly you, a vidyādhara, will be able to decipherThese magical
scrolls of the ḍākinīs,Which ordinary beings cannot comprehend.These Dharma treasures that
containThe symbolic scripts of the Blazing Relics of Enlightened Body [10] will be,Immediately
upon their bestowal by the ḍākinī of all-pervading space,Entrusted to you, one with
the yogic conduct of great purityAnd endowed with the four perfect knowledges.Lacking such
mastery, some people pretend that ordinary teachings fabricated by the conceptual mindAre
profound treasures.These things  are like a mere paintingAnd an insult to the authentic
treasures of the Lotus-Born.At that time, although difficult to fathom by fools,Wise persons
such as you will know its nature.”May anyone with a connectionTo the Lord of Dance Jigme
Lingpa be benefited!Samaya.Seal, seal, seal! Let the signs be absorbed!
