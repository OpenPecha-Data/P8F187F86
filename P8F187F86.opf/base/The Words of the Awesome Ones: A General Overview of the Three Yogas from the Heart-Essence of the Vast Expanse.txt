The Words of the Awesome Ones

A General Overview of the Three Yogas

from the Heart-Essence of the Vast Expanse

revealed by Jigme Lingpa

Homage to the primordial expanse of Samantabhadra!

The single all-encompassing sphere of awarenessIs the place wherein all phenomena are liberated.Although
inconceivable vehicles of sūtra and mantra are taught,In fact, there is only
one vehicle.

Ignorant, conceptually inclined beingsWill dispute the words of the vehicles.For as long as
beings abound in conceptual thoughtsThere will likewise be an inconceivable number of vehicles.This
is what I, Samantabhadra, have taught.

Yet here, if we categorize these vehicles based on beings’ faculties,There are the superior,
middling, and inferior.When all three are divided once again into three,Nine vehicles are
taught:The vehicles leading from the origin,The vehicles of knowledge through ascetic practices,And
the vehicles of powerful transformative methods.

Among them, the paths that swiftly liberateExtremely fortunate individuals in one lifetimeAre
the vehicles of powerful transformative methods:For those with superior faculties there
is the path of the Great Perfection;For those with middling faculties, the supreme Anuyoga;And
for those with lesser faculties, the Mahāyoga.

The essence of the generation phase is gradualism.It serves as the ground for the entire Secret
Mantra.The nature of the perfection phase is instantaneity.It is like the path of all
the Secret Mantra.The Great Perfection is the Dharma beyond the mind.It is said to be the
fruition of all the Secret Mantra.

The Mahāyoga

Absolute, unborn reality radiatesWith the miraculous manifestations of the three concentrations.To
purify grasping, the world and beingsArise as the circle of the palace and the deities.Concerning
the deities born from awareness,To reduce self-importance,Apply the antidote
of subduing thoughts:Meditate on the play of the main deity and retinueIn their limitless
forms with variations in faces and limbsThat are symbolic and illustrate the ultimate meaning.When
within the emanated maṇḍala of the world and beingsOne’s three doors [are blessed]
through deity, mantra and samādhi,Confidence in the practice is born.Train as one’s own
children and the child of others.From the empowerment of compassion, the empowerment of
insight,And the cakra of the wisdom mudrā:

Firstly, for the approach phase,All that appears and exists, saṃsāra and nirvāṇa,Including the
aggregates, elements, and sense sourcesAre understood to be the utterly pure maṇḍala of
deities.By training in purity,The Thus-Gone Ones are actualizedAs one’s own children.

Secondly, the close approachIs to approach the wisdom deity itself.Its blessing ripens your
mindAnd you train in completely awakeningUnsurpassable wisdom.Like melting, beating and polishing
gold,Practice naturally and assiduouslyAnd you will becomeA child of the Thus-Gone
Ones.

Thirdly, there is the accomplishment phase.The wisdom gained from practicing generation and
completion phasesGives rise to boundless great compassion,Through the force of which you uphold
the great samayaThat is consistent with benefitting all beings.This is to make the Thus-Gone
OnesOne’s own children.

Fourthly, there is the great accomplishment.Based on the two great accumulationsYou and others
engage in the maṇḍala of group accomplishment.Having actualized the qualities of abandonment
and realizationThe two aims are spontaneously accomplished.This is to become the childOf
the Thus-Gone Ones.

In this way, through the miraculous displayOf the four branches of approach and accomplishmentYou
will gain confidence in meditative absorption,[1]And with its power you will perfect,
within the confines of your body,All the qualities of the ten grounds and the five paths.


Then, there are the manifestations of the three objects,[2]Killing the three enemies, defeating
the four demonsAnd avoiding the three ravines.

Through the strength of merit and wisdom,One gains confidence in generation and perfection,Eliminates
course thoughts,And the forms of the wisdom deitiesInitially manifest as mental
objects.

Through the power of the deities’ actual appearance reaching their full extentAnd the proper
training of the mindThe deities manifest as sensory objects.

Finally, when the body and mind are perfectly trainedThe deities of the indivisible two truthsManifest
in actuality as tangible objects.

When these three objects are masteredThe appearance of the impure body is conqueredAnd you reach
the supreme levelsOf the matured, power-over-life, mahāmudrāAnd spontaneously accomplished
vidyādhara.

When the circle of generationIs sealed with the profound perfection phaseThe outer enemy of
grasping at ‘mine’,The inner enemy of clinging to a selfAnd the secret enemy of emotions and
all dualistic graspingAre destroyed by the pure deity’s aggregates.The sign that you have
slain the three enemiesIs that you no longer cling to the ordinary aggregates.

The four demons are defeated in the following way.Within the vast expanse of great bliss,From
the causal Heruka, the union of means and insight—The play of the great bliss-emptiness,Arise
clouds of bodhicitta nectar,Inconceivable wisdom,In arrays that radiate and are reabsorbed.Without
any attachment or grasping, the five poisons are enacted,Offerings made to
the Noble Ones and the benefit of others fulfilled.At that time, the demon of emotions is
defeated.

By knowing that all attachment, anger and grasping thoughtsAre the radiance of non-dual, naturally
arisen wisdom,Then, within the dharmatā reality free from abandoning and attainingAnd
beyond the bias of refuting and establishing things,The deceitful demon of the son of the
gods is defeated.

By realizing that the five limbs of the vajra aggregatesAre the five perfect buddhasAnd by taking
the form of the pure deity,The demon of the ordinary aggregates is defeated.

The final fruition of the two accumulationsIs buddhahood and confidence in the generation and
perfection phases.Therein not a single thoughtOf birth or death exists,And so the demon
of the Lord of Death is defeated.

Through the view free from partialityYou escape the ravine of doubt and uncertainty.Through
the meditation free from brightness and dimnessYou escape the ravine of dullness and agitation.Through
the samayas of unerring conductYou escape the ravine of the inferior vehicles.


The bases of purification are the ordinary body, speech, and mind,And the agents of purification
are deity, mantra, and samādhi,Through which the results of purification, the Sugata’s
body, speech, and mind, are obtained.Within the circle of the three vajrasOne is fully ripened
and obtains ultimate Buddhahood.

These tenets of the Mahāyoga,
I, the Awesome One, have thus explained.

Samaya.

The Great Scripture, Anuyoga

From the ultimate, basic space of phenomena,The perfectly pure expanse of Samantabhadrī,Arises
awareness—Samantabhadra.

Without relying on words, while resting in the viewOf the natural, spontaneous presenceOf basic
space and wisdom indivisible,Generate the maṇḍala of the relative deityThrough the power
of mindful awareness.Through the profound, spontaneously present meditative concentrationThe
stains of the two obscurations are purifiedAnd the resultant four kāyas are actualized:This
is taught to be the Anuyoga of perfection.

This tradition defeats the four demons in the following way.Knowing that the three poisons are
primordially the three kāyas,One realizes that emotions are primordially buddhas.Beyond
refutation and affirmation, adopting and abandoning,The demon of emotions is defeated.

By realizing that phenomena and individuals,Imputed as knowable things, visible and designated,Are
selfless and of equal taste,The dualistic grasping, the demon of the son of the gods,
is defeated.

All the aggregates, elements, and sense sourcesAre unborn and primordially perfect as the mudrā
of the deity.They are equal yet distinct, and spontaneously present.Thus attachment and
clinging, the demon of the aggregates, is defeated.

Within the unchanging expanse of the nature of reality,The divisions of life, death, and intermediate
state fall away.Thus within basic space there is nothing to be removed, nothing
that obscures,And so the demon of the Lord of Death is defeated.

Samaya.

The Natural Great Perfection

Know that the deity itself is the actual bodhicittaAnd mind itself is the buddha;This is not
created but has always been so.

Anything whatsoever that arisesIs unceasing and unestablished—its nature is clarity.This natural
radiance that is free from thoughts and expressionsArises as the various mudrās of the
major and minor marks.Merely appearing, yet not established—it is empty.

The way in which this tradition defeats the four demons is as follows.Sky-like awarenessHas
never been tainted by the defects of the poisons.Quicksilvery wisdomDefeats the great demon
of emotions.

The three planes of existence are primordially awakened,Spontaneously present as the kāyas and
pure realmsAnd beyond effort and exertion, causes and conditions.And so the demon of the
sons of the gods, with his divine appearance, is defeated.

In the space of great insight beyond thoughts,The reality wherein there is no reified appearance,There
are no dualistic thoughts of clinging, permanence, and nihilism,And so the compounded
demon of the aggregates is defeated.

Intangible awareness,The wisdom of mindfulness and clarity,Is the dharmakāya, beyond birth and
death.And so the demon of the Lord of Death is defeated.

This is the great tenet of Ati.

Samaya.

The three yogas just explained
Can be further subdivided
And explained in nine sections.

The maṇḍala that is gradually generatedIs referred to as the Mahā of Mahā.The maṇḍala that is
spontaneously presentIs referred to as the Anu of Mahā.The absolute and unborn dharmadhātuIs
known as the Ati of Mahā.

The instantaneously perfected maṇḍalaIs asserted to be the Mahā of Anu.While the relative is
the maṇḍala of the deity,The absolute is the pure space of phenomena:This is referred to
as the Anu of Anu.The indivisibility of the deity and natural awarenessIs referred to as the
Atiyoga of Anu.

Knowing saṃsāra and nirvāṇa to be primordially the maṇḍalaIs referred to as the Mahā of Ati.Knowing
mind to be spontaneously perfect as the deity’s formIs referred to as the Anu of Ati.The
essenceless space of the nature of mind,Free from any conceptual elaborations,Is referred
to as the Ati of Ati.

Here I have explained the generation and perfection phasesOf the ground, path, and fruition,Three
sets of three,Making nine divisions in total.

An explanation of the samayas was also included here, but I put off deciphering it and did not
write it down.

These crucial points are greatly secret and superior to all,Of few words yet meaningful, the
very essence of the tantra section.This general overview of the three yogasWas given to the
vidyādharaBearing the marks of a warrior at the point between his eyebrows,Who was blessed
by Mañjuśrī-dharmamitra.Then it passed to the great Karmendrāṇī.When she revealed the
intent of the symbolic scriptsI, [Padmasambhava], gained mastery over the great secret treasury
of the ḍākinīs,In the depths of my mind.May it perfectly enter [my disciples'] heartsAnd
their perception arise as words and texts.It is the quintessence of the treasures.There
is no doubtThat my three fortunate heart sons will receive it.I fully entrust it to them.If
it is taught to unsuitable vessels, its meaning will be distorted.The protectress of
Mantra will guard it.May the benefit of beings increase and the Teachings flourish!

Samaya! Let the signs be absorbed.
